        I&apos;m super comfortable with upskilling on the internet as I&apos;ve
        been on the self-taught journey for a few years now. I take a keen
        interest in learning cutting-edge technologies in the hopes that these
        will one day have a direct impact on our lives and Blockchain is
        definitely one such innovation. When I came across NFTs for the first
        time in early 2021, it was kinda evident to me from day one itself, that
        non-fungible tokens are going to shape the online world&apos;s future.
        Gradually, almost everything in the digital realm is going to get
        tokenized. Thinking about the potential of web3 (including DeFi, social
        protocols, audio tokens, etc.) makes me really excited and now I want to
        be a significant contributor to the metaverse. But before I can do that,
        I need to take my web2 coding skills to the next level. That&apos;s why
        I&apos;m learning blockchain engineering using Solidity. It&apos;ll help
        me explore my fascination with dApps in a much better way. And who
        knows, maybe someday Maa will be really proud of me!
